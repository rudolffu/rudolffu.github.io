      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reposted from &lt;a href=&#34;https://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/info/1031/9270.htm&#34;&gt;KIAA-PKU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Peking University announces an advancement in cosmic exploration with the release of the CatNorth quasar candidate catalog, as recently published in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series. The international collaborative study, led by Dr. Yuming Fu and Prof. Xue-Bing Wu, presents an enhanced set of over 1.5 million reliable quasar candidates, building upon the initial Gaia DR3 quasar candidate catalog noted for its substantial size but low purity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are located at the edge of the Galactic disk, and see our Galaxy as a hazy band of light made of countless stars in the night sky. Looking for extragalactic objects like quasars through this band of light is so hard that this region has long been called the “Zone of Avoidance” for extragalactic astronomy. But now, a new research program makes it hard for quasars to hide themselves behind the Galactic plane.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
